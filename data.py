            Keys: '1', 'game'
            This option contains 2 games:
                Calculation Game
                    Generates various calculation expressions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
                Guess Person Game
                    Provides information about a person related to math. You must guess their name.
                        Note: Enter the entire name without mistakes in a case-insensitive manner.
            Game Selection Keys:
                Calculation: 'c', 'calculate', 'calculating', 'calculation'
                Guess Person: 'g', 'guess', 'guessing'
                Return to Main Menu: 'b', 'back' or 'Ctrl+D' (Windows) / 'Ctrl+Z' (Linux/macOS)
            Additional Keys in Each Game:
                'a' or 'answer' in a case-insensitive manner.
                Return to Games Menu: 'b', 'back' or 'Ctrl+D' (Windows) / 'Ctrl+Z' (Linux/macOS)

        Random Fact üéÅ
            Keys: '2', 'fact'
            Prints a random fact about math.

            
        Chatüó®Ô∏è
            Keys: '3', 'chat'
            It is a chat with neural network assistant, which is using openai assistant api to generate responses
        
        Close Current Session üëã
            Keys: '4', 'exit', 'close', 'session'
            Asks if you want to save the session:
                If 'yes', you need to enter the file format ('PDF' or 'TXT') and filename in a case-insensitive manner.
                    If the file already exists, you will be asked if you want to replace the existing data.
                    If 'no', you will be asked for the filename again.
                After closing the session, you will see a cow saying 'Auf Wiedersehen' (Goodbye).
            Note: To return to the Main Menu, you can use 'Ctrl+D' (Windows) or 'Ctrl+Z' (Linux/macOS).

Additional Notes:
    1. Your input may contain multiple keys, but the first one will be used.
    2. If your input does not contain any key, you will receive an error message.
    3. You can enter keys in a case-insensitive manner.
    4. For 'yes/no' prompts, you can use 'Y' or 'Yes' for 'yes' and anything else for 'no'.
    5. You can always return to the Main Menu, Games Menu, or close the program using 'Ctrl+D' (Windows) or 'Ctrl+Z' (Linux/macOS).
