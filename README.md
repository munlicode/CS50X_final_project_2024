- **Interactive Games**: Enjoy educational games that test your arithmetic skills and challenge your knowledge of famous mathematicians.
- **Educational Explanations**: Gain insights into various math topics with detailed explanations and resources.
- **Problem Solving**: Quickly solve and simplify mathematical expressions using an intuitive interface.
- **Random Math Facts**: Discover interesting facts about mathematics to enhance your knowledge.

The program is highly flexible, allowing for easy addition of new topics, games, and features. This makes it a dynamic tool that can grow with user needs and interests.

#### Detailed Features:

- **Main Function**: Acts as the entry point of the program, coordinating the flow and managing the interaction between different features. It ensures a smooth user experience by guiding them through the various options and functionalities available in Math Assistant.
- **Choices Function**: Handles the user‚Äôs input, interpreting their selections to navigate through different sections of the program. This function is crucial for ensuring that users can access the features they want quickly and efficiently.
- **Usage Guide üìÉ**: Provides a comprehensive guide to help users understand how to navigate and utilize the various options available in Math Assistant.
- **Games üéÆ**: Includes two fun and educational games:
  - **Calculation Game**: Tests your ability to solve basic arithmetic problems.
  - **Guess Person Game**: Challenges you to guess the name of a math-related person based on clues.
- **Random Fact üéÅ**: Provides a random math fact to enhance your knowledge and make learning more enjoyable.
- **Chatüó®Ô∏è**: It is a chat with neural network assistant, which is using openai assistant api to generate responses
- **Close Current Session üëã**: Allows users to save their session in either PDF or TXT format before exiting. If the file already exists, the user is prompted to confirm whether they want to replace the existing data.

This tool is perfect for students, educators, or anyone interested in sharpening their math skills in an engaging and interactive way.
>[!TIP]
>1.You can enter keys in a case-insensitive manner.
